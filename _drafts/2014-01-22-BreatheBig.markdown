Breathe Big is a tool kit for parents whose children have been diagnosed with asthma. Asthma is the most common chronic disorders in children and is a dangerous but manageable disorder. The Breathe Big Box comes with a guide which explains the basics of asthma and instructions on how to manage it so that every child can do everything they want to do. The box also includes a peak flow meter and charts, an inhaler pouch, and inhaler aid cards. Every kid can breathe big.
