W.B. is the manifesto of American writer and activist Wendell Berry. This collection of short narratives, poems, and essays focuses on Berry’s call for a return to healthy rural communities. Textured silhouettes and a rustic color palette, applied to both type and photography, allude to Berry’s ideal life - simple, frugal, and on the farm.
